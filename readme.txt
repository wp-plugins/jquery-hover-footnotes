Contributors: Lance
Tags: footnotes
Requires at least: 2.6
Tested up to: 2.8
Stable tag: trunk



== Description ==

JQuery Hover Footnotes lets you add footnotes with qualifiers of you're choosing, then dynamically displays them 
on hover-over. So you can easily add footnotes to a post by wrapping them in qualifiers, then they will dynamically 
display in a jQuery hover popup when the user mouses-over the footnote link.  There is also a settings page where 
you can change options like the footnote formatting.



**Usage**

To anchor a footnote use the {{FOOTNOTE_NUMBER}}. Then to write the body of it you need to embrace it 
with [[FOOTNOTE_NUMBER]].

== Installation ==


Activate like any plugin. Just copy the yafootnote.php file in the plugins directory and 
activate. Then start writing!
